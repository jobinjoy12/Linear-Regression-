# Report on Car Price Prediction

## 1. Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to create a predictive model for estimating car prices based on various features. By analyzing the relationship between different numerical attributes of cars and their prices, we aim to build an accurate linear regression model. This model can provide valuable insights for both buyers and sellers in the automotive market.

## 2. Introduction:
Accurately predicting car prices is essential for stakeholders such as dealerships, manufacturers, and consumers. Understanding the factors influencing car prices can aid in making informed decisions regarding pricing strategies, purchasing, and investments. This project utilizes a dataset containing information about cars and their attributes to develop a predictive model, shedding light on how these attributes affect car prices.

| ...               | Additional attributes such as engine size, horsepower, etc.                                                |
| Price             | Car price.                                                                                                |

## 4. Methodology

### Data Loading and Inspection:
Load the dataset and inspect its structure, including features and the target variable.

### Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features if needed.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explore the dataset, identify correlations between features and the target variable, and visualize patterns.

### Feature Selection:
Select relevant features with significant correlation with the target variable for model training.

### Model Training:
Split the data into training and testing sets, then train a linear regression model using selected features.

### Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model using metrics such as MSE, MAE, R2, and RMSE to assess its performance.

### Visualization:
Visualize actual vs. predicted prices and plot regression lines to understand predictive accuracy.

## 5. Model Training Process

- **Importing Required Libraries**:
  - Imports necessary libraries and modules for building and evaluating a linear regression model.

- **Loading Data**:
  - Reads the data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

- **EDA**:
  - Inspects the data, summarizes statistics, explores unique values, and identifies columns.

- **Data Selection**:
  - Selects numerical columns for analysis.

- **Correlation Analysis**:
  - Calculates correlation coefficients between numerical features and the target variable ('price').

- **Creating a New DataFrame**:
  - Creates a new DataFrame using 'enginesize' and 'price' for model training.

- **Splitting Data**:
  - Splits the data into training and testing sets.
